## Switching

To guarantee that your bot will receive all updates, you must deregister it with the `https://api.telegram.org` server by calling the method [logOut](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#logout).
After the bot is logged out, you can replace the address to which the bot sends requests with the address of your local server and use it in the usual way.
If the server is launched in `--local` mode, make sure that the bot can correctly handle absolute file paths in response to `getFile` requests.

## Moving

If the bot is logged in on more than one server simultaneously, there is no guarantee that it will receive all updates.
To move a bot from one local server to another you can use the method [logOut](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#logout) to log out on the old server before switching to the new one.

If you want to avoid losing updates between logging out on the old server and launching on the new server, you can remove the bot's webhook using the method
[deleteWebhook](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#deletewebhook), then use the method [close](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#close) to close the bot instance.
After the instance is closed, locate the bot's subdirectory in the working directory of the old server by the bot's user ID, move the subdirectory to the working directory of the new server
and continue sending requests to the new server as usual.
